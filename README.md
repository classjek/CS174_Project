# BruinRun
Final project for UCLA CS174A Fall 2023

# Theme

# Gameplay Overview 
The Bruinwalk game contains three scenes: Ackerman, Kerckhoff, and Janss, each separated by a blockade of red posters. The goal of the game is to reach the end of each scene without colliding with a starship bot or person flyering. The bots move horizontally on the walkway, and the flyer people approach the player from the side. If the player colllides with either enemy, they are given a flyer and lose the game. The game can be restarted using 'z'. 
Press enter to move past the start screen and see Bruinwalk. To start running, press 'q'. The player will run until the end of a scene is reached. The player can be moved left and right using the 'a' and 'd' keys, respectively. The player can jump over starships using the space bar, and can land on starships without losing the game. 
There is a scene graph in the lower left corner that displays the location of the enemies and of the player on Bruinwalk.
